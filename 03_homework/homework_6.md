**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on previous tasks, I recognize the importance of incorporating ethics and equity to create fair, transparent, and responsible data systems. When creating logical data models or writing SQL queries, itâ€™s crucial to protect personal information and consider measures like data anonymization.

Ensuring data privacy and security is a major ethical aspect. When working with sensitive information, such as customer data in farmersmarket.db, I must implement measures to protect it from unauthorized access. Additionally, maintaining data accuracy and integrity through regular audits is essential for making informed decisions.

The power of SQL in merging and summarizing data, particularly with JOIN and AGGREGATE functions, comes with the responsibility to prevent biases. For instance, when generating customer lists, it's vital to ensure the selection criteria do not discriminate against any group.

Moving forward, I will prioritize these principles to contribute to more ethical and equitable data practices.
